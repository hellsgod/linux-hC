## linux-hC

This repository is for my personal use. linux-hC and linux-hC-rc uses the PKGBUILD provided by CachyOS [OFFICIAL REPO](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos)

I modified it slightly for my personal use and I use patches from ZEN/Cachy/Clear/Xanmod/pf-kernel to build a kernel for my liking. I do this patches by myself, you find the repositories for these patches in my linux kernel [REPO](https://github.com/hellsgod/linux)

This readme ist still WIP.
